Way of working.

I got stuck on the last assignment: everytime I would run the check script I ended up with a test object as weapon for my hero object. Because it returned with the test weapon when I invoke the equipFunction I look for a way to empty the array before invoking it (rule 59-62). It did give me the check mark but still gave me the item.

The other function also worked when the weren't supposed to.
After recoding for some time in te texteditor I stopped and started drawing out the function, parameteres en arguments. It was at this point that things became more clear to me how I could write the functions better. I rewrote all of them to make them do what the should do and only when the should do it. Drawing them out gave me a better oversight of what was suppose to happen and how.

Alot of time went in to figuring out complecated thing, like the hero moving over the screen. After some hours I gave up because for it the work it would take me way to long.

The last hours or so I spend on making it look a bit more appealing and try to do some of the extra assignments. 

All function show up in the console.log but I didn't manage to get them on the screen.
