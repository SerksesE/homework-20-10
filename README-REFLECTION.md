Way of working.




I got stuck on the last assignment: everytime I would run the check script I ended up with a test object as weapon for my hero object.

At the end I stopped coding in my texteditor and started drawing out the function, parameteres en arguments. It was at this point that things became more clear to me how I could write the functions. I rewrote all of them to make them do what the should do and only when the should do it. 

Alot of time went in to figuring out complecated thing, like the hero moving over the screen. I did this in a separate file to not mess anything up. After some hours I gave up because I for it the work it would take me longer than I had the time for.

The last hour or so I spend on making it look a bit more appealing and try to do some of the extra assignments.
